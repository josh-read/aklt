# AKLT

The AKLT model is a one dimensional chain of spin 1 particles, described by the following Hamiltonian:

The physical significance of the AKLT model is well explained by its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKLT_model).

In a nutshell, it illustrates how topological phases arise, as changing the topology (in this case going from an open to a closed ring) results in a change to the low energy spectrum.
